In a PrivateRoute we use a PrivateRouteGuard component that redirects to a login page if no user is set. 
The PrivateRouteGuard sets the current location pathname as a state in the redirect, so that we know from which private page we came. 
The Login component can then, upon successful login, redirect back to the private page.
